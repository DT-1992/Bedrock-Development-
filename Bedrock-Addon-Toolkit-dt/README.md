

this software should provide an easy way to do these things if it gets finished:

  Addon Scans for:
    ->Compability
    ->JSON validation
  
  Addon update/changes:
    ->  Because Bedrock is a hell in case of version updates in code for developers
        its often the case that users cant run their addons anymore,
        so this tool will try to update the json files with help of the newest samples from bedrock
     -> let jsbeautify run over your addon so files become formatet and readable,
        so you can better read and understand whats inside
     
  Build An lib of your Addons for further use:
    ->  Create an Lib from your addons with will stay up to date,
        with some extra data to make the compilation out of it
  
  Create an Addon Compilatation from your lib:
    ->  Create an Addon based on the newest bedrock sample of your choise,
        containing the choosen addons of your lib
     -> files will be placed in subfolders for each addon so no conflicts with as example differnt car.json 
        can occour
      ->some file will not be placed in subfolders because they manipulate vanilla things so we have to merge these 
      
      -> Options to Choose as Compilation Extras:
        texturepack
        shader
        subpacks 
        etc

Work in Progress....
